For the second week of our sprint we decided to improve in our development and switched framework. We switched from ASP.Net RazorPages to React due to the 
better connectivity with Unity and Webgl. This also allowed us to fully connect backend and frontend in one framework for flawless cooperation and 
integration. Thses changes can be observed from the webgl-webaapp branch soon it will be merged into our main branch.
